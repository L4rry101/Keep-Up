Welcome to the Turati Keep Up Repository

What is Keep-Up?

Keepup is a plartform that servers to help people in mainting their suburb conditions. KeepUp helps the suburb by providing
a plartform where citizens can donate their money and time to clean the streets, pull out weeds, pick-up litter,
resore pavement, replace stolen strom water drain covers and many more ways that can keep the suburb in a good condition.
When you donate to help your suburb become better and clean, keepup makes sure your donations are put to good use
and the suburb is clean.
